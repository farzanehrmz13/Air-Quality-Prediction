It is just for figuring out how to deal with this kind of dataset.

Pollutants

Carbon Monoxide (CO):
On average, CO levels sit around 2.1 mg/m³. Most of the time, they’re between 1 and 3, which isn’t too alarming. But sometimes the levels spike up to nearly 12. Those jumps are short-lived, likely tied to traffic jams or bursts of emissions.

Nitrogen Oxides (NOx):
This one is far less stable. The average is about 247 ppb, but it can climb to 1,479 ppb, which is really high. These sudden surges probably happen during rush hours or when industrial activity is strong.

Nitrogen Dioxide (NO₂):
With an average of 113 ppb, NO₂ is more steady compared to NOx, though it still shows some noticeable ups and downs. This suggests constant urban pollution with occasional stronger episodes.

Weather Conditions

Temperature:
Ranges from -2 °C in winter to over 44 °C in summer, with an average of 18 °C. The dataset clearly covers all seasons.

Relative Humidity (RH):
Varies widely, from 9% (dry air) to almost 90% (very humid), averaging around 50%. This tells us the measurements capture both dry and humid days.

Absolute Humidity (AH):
Averages about 1.0 g/m³, moving between 0.2 and 2.2. This basically mirrors moisture changes with temperature and RH.

The dataset is now reliable and realistic after cleaning.

NOx is the main troublemaker — highly unstable with extreme pollution peaks.

CO is moderate most of the time, but spikes show clear signs of traffic emissions.

Weather factors (temperature and humidity) will play a big role in explaining when and why pollution levels rise or fall.
